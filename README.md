# Expensive

A simple expense report generator that parses PDF files that banks, credit card providers and other financial institutions provide & generates a holistic overview of financial expenditure.

## Aims

- Simple to use (i.e. ideally one command execution)
- Generate usable information immediately without further parsing
- Automatic classification of expenses when possible, ask when not & learn

## Current Status

WIP, pretty much nothing works yet.
